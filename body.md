### How Can I Get Write Access?

<section markdown='1'>

You can request write access once you've joined the room. When a room owner is available, they will check to see if you can join. We have some criteria that people must meet before they're given access.

### Requirements for access:

- Don't display obvious [help-vampire](http://slash7.com/2006/12/22/vampires/) qualities.

- Don't use a default username, such as user31415926, or u234. We prefer you choose a name that won't be lost among the others — user1234, user2341, and user3241 are hard to pick apart in discussions.

- Make sure you've asked and answered reasonable questions on Stack Overflow. We expect you to have contributed somehow to Stack Overflow before joining the chat, and that you've answered at least as many questions as you've asked.

- Don't request write access repeatedly in an effort to get attention. This just annoys us, and we'll put you on the ban list.

### What Are The Rules?

<section markdown='1'>

1. Before you ask a question here, first [thoroughly](http://stackoverflow.com/search) [research](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/search) [it](https://www.google.com) [yourself](http://www.ietf.org/rfc.html), and post it on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) (or another appropriate Stack Exchange site, like [programmers.se](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/)). We also expect you to read the [Android developer site](http://developer.android.com/) before asking a question about Android.

2. Use English and try to write well. This means no chat-speak (e.g., "u r vry gud i m new dev lol").

3. Don't paste blocks of code into the chat. Make a [gist] or use another pastebin if you must share code. Any code in the chatroom should be limited to one line at about 80 columns max.

4. Don't ping users (@username-ing) unless it's to clarify who you're speaking to or you need to get a specific person's attention. Pinging for help is bannable.

5. Everything kitty-related is allowed.

6. Images MUST be safe for work. Please don't post unprofessional images. Kitties and unicorns: okay. A screenshot of your app: sure. Twerking: no.

7. Don't flag messages you find personally offensive (e.g., swear words, blasphemy, and so on). It just annoys the people who have to respond to flags.

8. Only codeMagic is allowed to buy and drink ass-Bourbon. Everyone else should know better.

The choice to enforce the rules is at the discretion of each room owner. The rules are purposefully difficult to break, we just ask that you not be a dick. Cheers, have fun, and be excellent to one another.

  <p>Welcome to Stack Overflow’s Android Room rules page. We heard you like Android and rules so we put unicorns in it because unicorns.</p>

  <p>This page is here to give you a complete list of rules specific to the Android chat room.</p>

<h3 id="how-can-i-get-write-access">How Can I Get Write Access?</h3>

<section>

  <p>Getting write access is easy, simply request write access once you’ve joined the room. When a room owner is available, they should check to see if you can join.</p>

  <p>Keep in mind that we don’t give write access to users who:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Display obvious <a href="http://slash7.com/2006/12/22/vampires/">help-vampire</a> qualities.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Use a default username, such as user31415926. We prefer you choose a name that won’t be lost among the others — user1234, user2341, and user3241 are hard to pick apart in discussions.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Have neither asked nor answered reasonable questions on Stack Overflow. We expect you to have contributed somehow to Stack Overflow before joining the chat.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Request write access repeatedly in an effort to get attention. This just annoys us.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

</section>

<h3 id="what-are-the-rules">What Are The Rules?</h3>

<section>

  <p>The rules are as follows:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>Don’t ask a question here before first <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/search">thoroughly</a> <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/search">researching</a> <a href="https://www.google.com">it</a> <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc.html">yourself</a> and posting it on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> (or another appropriate Stack Exchange site, like <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/">programmers.se</a>). We also expect you to read the <a href="http://developer.android.com/">Android developer site</a> before asking a question about Android.</p>

      <p class="note">When you share a link to an SO question, paste the link in the chat box with no other text. This allows the chat to one-box the question.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Use English and try to write well. This means no chat-speak (e.g., “u r vry gud i m new dev lol”).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Don’t paste blocks of code into the chat. Make a <a href="https://gist.github.com/">gist</a> or use another pastebin if you must share code. Any code in the chatroom should be limited to one line at about 80 columns max.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Don’t ping users (@username-ing) unless it’s to clarify who you’re speaking to or you need to get a specific person’s attention. Pinging for help is bannable.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Everything unicorn-related is allowed.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Please don’t post unprofessional images. Kitties and unicorns: okay. A screenshot of your app: sure. Twerking: no.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Don’t flag messages you find personally offensive (e.g., swear words, blasphemy, and so on). It just annoys the people who have to respond to flags.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>The choice to enforce the rules is at the discretion of each room owner. The rules are purposefully difficult to break, we just ask that you not be a dick. Cheers, have fun, and be excellent to one another.</p>

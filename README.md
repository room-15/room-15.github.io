# Android Room Rules

This repo is used to hold the the room rules page for the [Stack Overflow Android chat room][room15]. 
The page is automatically generated by `travis` on every commit and automatically pushed to the repo. 

Currently, the built rules are hosted at <http://room-15.github.io>.

## Contribute 

If you want to add changes to the room rules, then just fork the repository, make your changes in the <b>`body.md`</b> file and send in a pull request.  
Do *not* edit the `index.html` file. This file is generated by the travis bot from the content of `body.md`.

For quick reference:

- `head.in` — this contains the top third of the output HTML, including the inline stylesheet and such.
- `tail.in` — the bottom third. Just closes off the remaining tags opened by the head.
- `body.md` — the rules text itself. Contains the revision number at the top. Each time a new version of the rules is published, this number should be incremented. Minor fixes don't merit revision increments.
